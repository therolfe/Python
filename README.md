# Python
A collection of Machine Learning examples using python - This is a work in progress and is being updated on a regular basis - Last updated on 16 July.

For this collection of examples I have chosen to use local Irish datasets for analysis whenever possible. I also will not use the standard classic teaching examples as these have been well documented online todate.  I have created this repository so that I can demonstrate my abilities in the areas of Machine Learning, Charting, Data Analysis amd minipulation using Python.
