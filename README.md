# Python
A collection of Machine Learning examples using python - This is a work in progress and is being updated on a regular basis - Last updated on 1st Nov 2018.

For this collection of examples, I have chosen to use local Irish datasets for analysis whenever possible. I have tried not to use the standard classic teaching examples as these have been very well documented online to date - and hence easily replicated. <br> <br>I  have created this repository so that I can demonstrate my abilities in the areas of Machine Learning, Charting, Data Analysis and manipulation using Python..

    <td width=67%> Using sample website data we are examining the affects of a new page button design on the flow of traffic on the website. The unit of measurement is determined by clicks on the new button and the old button. The traffic would be recorded as two data sets, the traffic using the old button (control group) and the new traffic using the new button (test group).This data is then analysed to determine the new button effectiveness using the T-values and P-values of the analysis.

    <td width=67%>NLTK is a powerful Python package that provides a set of diverse natural languages algorithms. It is free, opensource, easy to use, large community, and well documented. NLTK consists of the most common algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition.The process of breaking down a text paragraph into smaller chunks such as words or sentence is called Tokenization. Token is a single entity that is building blocks for sentence or paragraph. In this project we analysis the 'mood' of film reviews to determine if a user likes or dislikes the film.                 <br><br><a href= "https://github.com/therolfe/Python/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20-%20using%20nltk%20for%20move%20review%20sentiment%20analysis.ipynb">Jupiter Notebook</a></th></td></tr>  <tr width=100% height =10 bgcolor="#c6c9ce" border="0"></tr>
