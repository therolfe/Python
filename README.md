# Python
A collection of Machine Learning examples using python - This is a work in progress as of 13 June

For this collection of Examples I have chosen to use local Irish datasets for analysis. I have created this repository so that I can
demonstrate my abilities in the areas of Machine Learning, Graphing and Data Analysis using Python.


Things to come<br><br>
